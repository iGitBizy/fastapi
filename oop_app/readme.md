 ### 2 ways to define an object

### 4 Pillars of OOP
- Encapsulation
    - refers to the Bundling of data
    - change public attributes to be private so they cannot be changes
- Abstraction
    - interface that allows a user to turn on/off functionality without needing to understand
    - hide implementation and only show necessary details
- Inheritance
    - Inheritance is the process of acquiring properties from one class to the next
    - creates hierachy between classes
- Polymorphism
